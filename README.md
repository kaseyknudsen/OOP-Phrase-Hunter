# OOP Phrase Hunter
 My 3rd tech degree project
 
In this project, using object oriented Python, a random phrase is selected from a list of 5 phrases. Inititally, The phrase is hidden from the user with underscores as a placeholder for each letter. The user is prompted to guess a letter. If the letter is in the phrase, the appropriate underscore is replaced with the guessed letter and reprinted out to the screen. The user is continually prompted until they have either guessed all the letters in the phrase or run out of guesses.
