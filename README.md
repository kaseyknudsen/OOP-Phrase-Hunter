# OOP Phrase Hunter
 Tech Degree Project 3

In this Object Oriented project, a random phrase is chosen from a list of 5 phrases. Initially, the phrase is printed with underscores as place holders for each letter. The user is prompted to guess a letter. If the letter guessed is in the random phrase, the underscore is replaced with the appropriate letter. The user has 5 chances to guess all the the correct letters. If the user guesses an incorrect letter, the number of guesses the user has is decremented by one. If the user guesses all the correct letters, a congratulations message is shown.
